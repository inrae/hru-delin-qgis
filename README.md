HRU delin QGIS plugin
=====================
Install hru-delin in one click!

What is it?
===========
This plugin is an all-in-one package to easily install and use hru-delin on GNU/Linux and Windows.
It has been tested and works on GNU/Linux and Windows with QGIS 3.8, 3.10 and 3.12.

What can I do with it?
======================
For the moment, the plugin's user interface is very basic. You can load a config file (just like you would do with classic hru-delin) and the plugin will run the 4 steps and load/display result files.
You can select which steps you want to run, in case you just want to run a few steps or you already have intermediate results and you want to finish the job.
